Project 1: I will be working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. I'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.

Project 2: In this project i will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. I will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
